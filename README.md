# ASP.NET Core Vue Starter

The repository contains an ASP.&#8203;NET Core + Vue.js starter template. The template runs on ASP.NET Core 3.1 and is created by Vue CLI 4.0 with a new plugin based architecture allowing developers to interactively scaffold a new project with just a one command.

Original code was copied and changed from this [repository](https://github.com/SoftwareAteliers/asp-net-core-vue-starter) and the article how to create the starter template [here](https://medium.com/software-ateliers/asp-net-core-vue-template-with-custom-configuration-using-cli-3-0-8288e18ae80b).

## Getting started

* Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/axi71/VueCore31`

Now application is ready to run.

## Run the application

You have three choices when it comes to how you prefer to run the app. You can either use the command line or the build-in run command.

### 1. Using the command line

* Run the .NET application using `dotnet run`

### 2. Using the built-in run command

* Run the application in VSCode or Visual Studio 2019 by hitting `F5` or `Strg+F5`

> It will take some time during the first run to download all client side dependencies.

## View your application running

Browse to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) for ASP.&#8203;NET Core + Vue app or browse to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) for Vue app only.
